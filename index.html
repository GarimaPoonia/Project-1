        <h2>ABOUT US</h2>
        <p>Welcome to VR SunCycle & Smart Bike, where innovation meets fitness and fun! We are a passionate team
            dedicated to revolutionizing the exercise gaming industry through immersive experiences that inspire active
            lifestyles.</p>
        <h3>Our Mission</h3>
        <p>At VR SunCycle & Smart Bike, our mission is clear: to motivate individuals to engage in physical activity
            while enjoying the thrill of gaming. We believe that exercise should be enjoyable, and our project is
            designed to make fitness fun for everyone.</p>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>VR SunCycle & Smart Bike is a cutting-edge simulation game that combines virtual reality technology with
            real-world exercise equipment. Our project originated with the vision of creating an interactive gaming
            experience that seamlessly integrates with smart bikes, providing users with an unparalleled level of
            immersion.</p>
        <h3>Goals and Objectives</h3>
        <p>In this trimester, our primary objective is to enhance the existing VR SunCycle by introducing new missions
            and features. We aim to improve responsiveness and fluidity in bike turning controls while seamlessly
            integrating incline detection to adjust pedalling difficulty. Our focus also includes expanding the virtual
            world to provide a richer experience and facilitating easier testing of IoT devices and VR setups.</p>
        <h3>Key Innovations</h3>
        <p>A key innovation of our project is pedal-based motion, where real-life pedalling directly influences in-game
            movement. By introducing varying inclines, we add a realistic and challenging dimension to the exercise
            experience, making workouts more engaging and effective.</p>
        <h3>Trimester Deliverables</h3>
        <p>To achieve our goals, we have outlined a series of trimester deliverables, including developing cosmetic
            items for customisation, introducing specific objectives and missions, achieving seamless integration across
            platforms, creating tutorial levels for new users, establishing in-game shops, implementing point storage
            systems, and enhancing navigation features.</p>
        <h3>Long-term Vision</h3>
        <p>Looking ahead, our long-term vision involves fully integrating VR headsets into the project for an immersive
            experience, ensuring smooth interaction between IoT devices and the game, and introducing challenging
            elements like inclines and interactive objects to enhance realism and enjoyment.</p>

            pedal your way to adventure and fitness like never before!</p>
